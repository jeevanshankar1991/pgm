% PROBLEM, PART, AND POINT COUNTING...

\newcounter{problemnum}

% Specify that problems should be labeled with arabic numerals.
\renewcommand{\theproblemnum}{\arabic{problemnum}}


% Create the part-within-a-problem counter, "within" the problem counter.
% This counter resets to zero automatically every time the PROBLEMNUM counter
% is incremented.
\newcounter{partnum}[problemnum]

% Specify that parts should be labeled with lowercase letters.
\renewcommand{\thepartnum}{\arabic{partnum}}

% Make a counter to keep track of total points assigned to problems...
\newcounter{totalpoints}

% Make counters to keep track of points for parts...
\newcounter{curprobpts}		% Points assigned for the problem as a whole.
\newcounter{totalparts}		% Total points assigned to the various parts.

% Make a counter to keep track of the number of points on each page...
\newcounter{pagepoints}
% This counter is reset each time a page is printed.

% This "program" keeps track of how many points appear on each page, so that
% the total can be printed on the page itself.  Points are added to the total
% for a page when the PART (not the problem) they are assigned to is specified.
% When a problem without parts appears, the PAGEPOINTS are incremented directly
% from the problem as a whole (CURPROBPTS).


%---------------------------------------------------------------------------


% The \problem environment first checks the information about the previous
% problem.  If no parts appeared (or if they were all assigned zero points,
% then it increments TOTALPOINTS directly from CURPROBPTS, the points assigned
% to the last problem as a whole.  If the last problem did contain parts, it
% checks to make sure that their point values total up to the correct sum.
% It then puts the problem number on the page, along with the points assigned
% to it.
